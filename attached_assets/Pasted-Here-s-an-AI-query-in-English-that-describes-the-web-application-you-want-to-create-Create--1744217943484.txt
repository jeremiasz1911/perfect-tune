**Create a Web Application for a Music Workshop and Classes Business**

I would like to create a web application with two parts: a front-end website and an admin/client dashboard. This application is for a company that runs music workshops and classes.

### **Web Pages (Frontend):**
1. **Home**
2. **About Me**
3. **Workshops**
4. **Gallery**
5. **Regular Classes**
6. **Login/Registration** (This page should change depending on whether the user is logged in or not)
7. **Contact**
8. **Terms and Conditions**
9. **Privacy Policy**

### **User Registration:**
- Parents should be able to register an account by providing their personal information: name, surname, address (street, city, postal code, apartment number, house number), and phone number.
- During registration, parents can add one or more children by providing the child’s name, surname, and age.
- Parents should be able to add or remove children during the registration process.
- The registration form should also include a checkbox for accepting the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.
- After registration, parents should be able to log in to the system and access the client dashboard.

### **User Dashboard (Parent):**
Once the parent is logged in, they should have access to the following features:
- **Dashboard:** A calendar of classes, the child’s attendance summary, payment history, and payment status.
- **Classes:** Ability to register the child for available classes or workshops, transfer the child to a different group, etc.
- **Payments:** Integration with Tpay for monthly payments for classes.
- **Account Settings:** Ability to update personal details.

### **Admin Dashboard:**
- **Dashboard:** Overview of total payments, number of registered users, and total accounts.
- **Classes:** Ability to create new classes (name, frequency, calendar).
- **Calendar:** A large calendar view with all classes and events.
- **Registered Users:** Information on all registered accounts with the option to edit them.
- **Settings:** Admin panel settings for managing the site.

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore Database)
- **Payment Integration:** Tpay (I will provide the necessary Tpay credentials)
- **Other Features:** Use modern technologies and add any useful components or functionalities that can enhance the user experience (e.g., notifications, real-time updates, etc.).
